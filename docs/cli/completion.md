# `afora completion`

Generate shell completion scripts, cache them under Afora state, and optionally install them into your shell profile.

## Usage

```bash
afora completion                          # print the detected shell's script
afora completion --shell fish             # print fish script
afora completion --write-state            # cache scripts for all shells
afora completion --write-state --install  # cache, then install in one step
afora completion --shell bash --write-state
```

## Options

- `-s, --shell <shell>`: shell target (`zsh`, `bash`, `powershell`, `fish`; detected from `$SHELL`, otherwise PowerShell on Windows and zsh elsewhere)
- `-i, --install`: install completion by adding a source line for the cached script to your shell profile
- `--write-state`: write completion script(s) to `$AFORA_STATE_DIR/completions` (default `~/.afora/completions`) without printing to stdout; with `--shell` writes only that shell, otherwise all four
- `-y, --yes`: skip install confirmation prompts (non-interactive)

## Install flow

`--install` points your profile at the cached script, so the cache must exist first: if it is missing, the command fails and tells you to run `afora completion --write-state`. Combine `--write-state --install` to do both in one step. Without `--shell`, the command preserves a recognized `$SHELL`; when `$SHELL` is missing or unrecognized, it defaults to PowerShell on Windows and zsh elsewhere.

The install writes a small `# Afora Completion` block into your shell profile and replaces any older slow `source <(afora completion ...)` lines with the cached source line:

| Shell      | Profile                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| bash       | `~/.bashrc` (falls back to `~/.bash_profile` when `~/.bashrc` is missing)                                                                                                                  |
| fish       | `~/.config/fish/config.fish`                                                                                                                                                               |
| powershell | `~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` (on Windows: `Documents/PowerShell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`, or `Documents/WindowsPowerShell/...` for Windows PowerShell) |
| zsh        | `$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc` when `ZDOTDIR` is defined; otherwise `~/.zshrc` (an empty `ZDOTDIR` resolves to `/.zshrc`)                                                                               |

Profile changes are staged beside the destination and atomically replace it only after a complete durable write. A failed install leaves an existing profile unchanged.

## Notes

- Without `--install` or `--write-state`, the command prints the script to stdout.
- Completion generation eagerly loads the full command tree, including plugin CLI commands, so nested subcommands are included.
- `afora update` refreshes the completion cache automatically after a successful update; `afora doctor` can repair missing or stale completion setups.
